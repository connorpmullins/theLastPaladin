Notes on the sequels:
. Idea for The Paladin Series
  1. Get selected to be a Paladin
  2. Learn to be a Paladin
  3. Be a Paladin and save the universe
  4. and more??

. Create a story that players feel incentivized by
. You have been selected to be a Paladin
. Before you assume the full roll and help keep the universe in order
  you need to learn to control your powers and become strong and just
. Learn from megamanX https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aip2aIt0ROM
. Face an ultimate evil, get your butt kicked, get saved by the Paladin
. Get introduced to your various powers by degrees
. If something is new, get a chance to see it before it kills you
. If a player dies, it's their fault, not yours
. "Every game is a conversation between the developer and the player"
  . Have the Player's choices fundamentally impact gameplay
    . What mechanic can cause this?
  . Blend elements of sidescroller and rpg
